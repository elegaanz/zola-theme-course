This theme allows you to publish only courses/tutorials structured in
parts and subparts, using Zola.

It automatically links pages of the course with the next and previous ones
for easy navigation. There is also a navigation bar at the top of each page
to easily navigate the whole tutorial, and for the reader to never be lost.

Each page can have an illustration.

It lets you customize some parts of the site, like the color palette.

It also features a light/dark mode switcher.

It also has some SEO features.

It was made for french courses, so a few parts of the interface may be in french.
You can easily adapt it to your language by editing the files in `themes/zola-theme-course/templates/`.
